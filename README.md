Magnitude: LLM Self-Improvement Experiment
From Directive to Framework: Autonomous Skill Acquisition

    "Do whatever you need to use the browser."

TL;DR: Magnitude is an experimental framework born from a simple goal: turning open-source LLM architectures into autonomous agents capable of self-directed learning. 
By granting the agent unrestricted browser access for skill acquisition, we mapped the transition from basic prompting to a structured framework for knowledge expansion.
📄 The White Paper

This repository contains the full research and results of the initial "Clawdbot" phase. Read the White Paper Here (or link to the specific file).
🚀 Key Features

    Autonomous Learning Loop: Logic for agents to identify knowledge gaps and use web resources to bridge them.

    Open-Code Integration: Built to demonstrate the power of agentic workflows on open-source foundations.

    Experimental Results: Documentation of the first 72 hours of autonomous browser interaction and framework formation.

🤝 Call for Collaboration

This is a "proof of possibility." I am releasing this to inspire researchers and developers to expand on this architecture. If you specialize in multi-agent systems or 
autonomous reasoning, I invite you to review the results and fork the repo to push these boundaries further.
